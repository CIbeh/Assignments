This scatterplot illustrates the magnitude of earthquakes relative to each of its corresponding depth.
This data was collected within the past 7 days(Mar 4 2017 -Mar 11 2017) and represents earthquakes with magnitudes over 2.5.
The depth is representative of how far below the eath surface the earthquake begins to rupture. This depth may be relative to the WGS84 geoid, mean sea-level, 
or the average elevation of the seismic stations which provided arrival-time data for the earthquake location. 
The choice of reference depth is dependent on the method used to locate the earthquake, which varies by seismic network. 
The depth is the least-constrained parameter in the earthquake location, and the error bars are generally 
larger than the variation due to different depth determination methods.
Sometimes when depth is poorly constrained by available seismic data, the location program will set the depth at a fixed value. 
For example, 33 km is often used as a default depth for earthquakes determined to be shallow, but whose depth is not 
satisfactorily determined by the data, whereas default depths of 5 or 10 km are often used in mid-continental areas 
and on mid-ocean ridges since earthquakes in these areas are usually shallower than 33 km.
In contrast, Earthquake magnitude is a measure of the size of an earthquake at its source. It is a logarithmic measure. 
At the same distance from the earthquake, the amplitude of the seismic waves from which the 
magnitude is determined are approximately 10 times as large during a magnitude 5 earthquake as during a magnitude 4 earthquake. 
The total amount of energy released by the earthquake usually goes up by a larger factor: for many commonly used magnitude types, 
the total energy of an average earthquake goes up by a factor of approximately 32 for each unit increase in magnitude. 

From our scatterplot, we are unable to draw in trends or correlations between the depth of rupture and the magnitude of an earthquake.
